## Select Projects from Cybersecurity Coursework

- The 8 months of coursework offered by UCLA Extention contained units ranging from Linux and Windows systems security and hardening, to network security, cloud security, penetration testing, SIEMS, and forensics. These select projects showcase some of this hands-on coursework.

- This repo contains a [Linux System Info bash script](Linux-System-Info-Script) and two projects. The first is documentation and instructions for an automated [ELK stack deployment](Automated-ELK-Stack-Deployment) using Ansible playbooks and Docker. The other is a report detailing a vulnerable [web server engagement](Web-Server-Engagement), including red team tactics, log analysis in Kibana, and mitigation and hardening strategies.
